# growth-directions-in-twisted-crystal-planes
Tool to analyze banded spherulite growth and determine the growth direction at a given Q space

The goal of this project is to analyze large batches of data and determine the direction of crystal growth for a given 
growth plane. Large image scans were collected from Brookhaven National Lab via wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and Q values were determined by plugging the data into Datasqueeze, a tool used for analysis of 2D X-ray data.
